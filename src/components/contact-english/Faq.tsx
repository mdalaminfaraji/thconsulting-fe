      question: "What are my obligations when hiring a foreign worker?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          After the work permit is issued, you need to ensure accommodation and
          food for the worker. Accommodation must meet minimum standards, and if
          food is not provided, you must pay the food allowance. You must also
          register the worker for social security and health insurance.

          No, the worker cannot come immediately. A work permit and visa are
          required. The process takes between 45 and 90 days, depending on the
          institutions.
